A2: Wireframes and Wireflow
Details 
In assessment 2, you will create and submit a single-page poster in A2 format with the wireframes and wireflow for your design solution. The design solution must respond to the design brief and should be informed by your background research (presented in assignment 1).
While assignment 2 is an individual submission, you are still required to perform. tasks towards the submission in coordination with your group members to ensure strong integration and consistency across the devices (remember that this is still a joint design project with another group submission coming up).
Assignment 2 tasks 
The completion of assignment 2 involves (at the minimum) the tasks outlined below. We have included indicative weeks next to each task to help you stay on track throughout the semester.
1 Week 5-6 Individually (but in coordination with your group members), create hand-sketched wireframes to explore potential solutions to the design brief for your chosen device. Consider doing multiple rounds of sketches before moving to the next step.
2 Week 6 As a group, complete a competitor analysis.
3 Week 6-7 Individually (but in coordination with your group members), create digital wireframes to iterate your design solution for your chosen device. Add annotations to your wireframes. Include at least 5 screens in your final digital wireflow that represent one or multiple paths of user interactions (e.g. to complete a specific task). Use FigJam AI to help with the ideation of your wireflow but iterate and reflect over the suggested flow. Consider doing multiple rounds of wireframes for one of your screens before building all 5 screens.
4 Week 7 Individually (but in coordination with your group members), create a wireflow for your chosen device.
5 Week 7 Individually, create a poster in A2 format (420 x 594 mm).
Assignment 2 submission format 
The process and final outcome of assignment 2 should be presented in the form. of a poster that is visually attractive and highly informative. The intent is to concisely convey, through a well-balanced selection of visuals and textual annotations, the final wireframes and the process of arriving at those wireframes.
You will be marked on your visual communication skills, so no templates will be accepted. You can use images and iconography, as long as they are referenced in your appendix. There is a strict limit to a single-page poster (reference list and appendix can be added to the PDF as additional pages). We highly recommend you to create your A2 poster (420 x 594 mm) in Figma but you can also use other graphic design tools such as Canva or Adobe InDesign. Please check the A2 poster template (https://www.figma.com/community/file/1410051552847846164) (published in Figma Community) for instructions regarding font sizes (e.g., the smallest font size to be used is 32px). If you decide to create your poster in Figma, you just need to click "Open in Figma" and it will create a new design file in your account using this template. If you decide to use other design software to create the poster, please be aware that adjustments to the font sizes may be necessary due to different software using different metrics. You are allowed to create the poster in portrait or landscape format.
Yo代 写A2: Wireframes and WireflowSQL
代做程序编程语言ur poster should contain the following:
Your details (name and student ID) clearly visible
Short summary of your envisioned design solution
Key insights from your competitor analysis
A selection of hand-sketched wireframes and digital wireframes (with annotations) that clearly show how and why the design changed through your iterations
Short reflection on the use of FigJamAI in supporting the ideation of user flow
Final wireflow (at least 5 screens) that is accompanied by annotations
References
ensure you apply correct citation to all your resources such as published statistics, literature, images, etc.
must be organised alphabetically as a list (either integrated into the poster or in the appendix)
using a consistent referencing style, for example APA:

(https://libguides.library.usyd.edu.au/c.php?g=508212p=3476096)
We ask you to also submit an appendix (no page limit) for A2. An appendix contains additional information that is too detailed for the poster itself but helps us evaluate the thoroughness and depth of your work. The appendix should complement the content of your poster. However, be aware that all key information must be included in the poster, and the appendix will be reviewed to clarify further details. You should consider including the following content in your appendix:
additional details/findings from your competitor analysis
additional wireframes / iterations that didn’t fit into the poster
The appendix will not be graded on visual presentation but please make sure that it's tidy and legible. Make sure you refer to the appendix from within the poster.
Submission Requirements 
Please submit poster and appendix in one single PDF. You can combine your poster-PDF and appendix-PDF with Adobe Acrobat application (Mac/Windows), in Preview (Mac) or with the free online PDF merge tool (https://www.adobe.com/au/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) from Adobe.
Language requirement 
Your poster should be submitted in English.
File size 
Please make sure you compress the PDF file before uploading it here. To compress your appendix PDF, you can use Adobe Acrobat Reader or using Small PDF (https://smallpdf.com/) .
Because we are using TurnItIn, the maximum file size is 40 MB.
If you are worried that the quality of your images suffers from compressing your submission, you can also include a link to a higher-resolution PDF – either by including the link in your submitted PDF or by adding the link as a comment on the Canvas assignment page:
Submission instructions 
All assignments are submitted via Turnitin. Submit your assignment as a single PDF file by the assessment due date. The PDF file should be named according to the following protocol:
A2_unikey.pdf (e.g.: "A2_mtom1234.pdf")
Assessment criteria 
A2 will be assessed according to the following criteria:
C1: Clarity of wireflow - (7.5 pts)
C2: Design quality (i.e., clarity of navigation and wayfinding, application of design patterns) - (7.5 pts)
C3: Evidence of iteration and incremental improvement across hand-sketched wireframes and digital wireframes - (5 pts)
C4: Visual Communication of Poster - (5 pts)
